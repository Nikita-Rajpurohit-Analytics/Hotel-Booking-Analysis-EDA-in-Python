Hotel Booking Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
Introduction:-
   This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a hotel booking dataset. 
   The aim is to uncover customer behavior, booking trends, cancellations, and pricing patterns that can help hotels optimize operations and improve revenue.
   The dataset contains booking information for City Hotels and Resort Hotels, with details on guest demographics, booking channels, cancellations, and pricing.

Dataset Overview:-
   Total Records: 119,390
   Records after cleaning: 87,226
   Features include: hotel type, booking status, arrival details, length of stay, number of guests, pricing, cancellations, and more.

Tools & Libraries Used:-
   Python
   Pandas – data wrangling and cleaning
   Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
   Jupyter Notebook – analysis and reporting

Key Insights:-
  Hotel Distribution – City Hotels dominate bookings; Resort Hotels lag behind.
  Cancellations – Higher in City Hotels, leading to revenue challenges.
  Seasonality – Clear peaks in demand during holiday months; low months require targeted promotions.
  Customer Satisfaction – Strongly linked to room allocation (reserved vs assigned).
  ADR (Average Daily Rate) – Increasing year by year, reflecting stronger pricing strategies.

Business Takeaways:-
  Encourage direct bookings to reduce OTA dependency and commissions.
  Apply flexible pricing strategies (dynamic pricing, early-bird discounts).
  Improve resort hotel offerings with better seasonal packages.
  Use loyalty programs to retain repeat customers.
  Enhance guest experience by minimizing booking errors (room mismatches).
